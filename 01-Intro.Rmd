# Introduction

## Need for the Study

* Mussels are important UMR biotic communities!
* Few methods exist for evaluating mussel habitat suitability for UMRR HREPs
* Spatially explicit models are helpful to evaluate spatial variation of habitat suitability across projects
* Evaluate impact of project features on existing mussel communities
* Evaluate likelihood that project features will create suitable habitat for mussels


## Species Distribution Modeling
Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) has become a common method for mapping suitable habitats for many species or taxa groups [@elith2008working, @elith2009species]. The `dismo` R package has been created to support SDM in R [see the `dismo` package vignette `sdm`, @hijmans2013species]. Another good overview of SDM in R [@hijmans_sdm].

Presence Data (dependent variables)

* Take advantage of existing UMR mussel data


Predictor Variables (independent variables)

* Many HREPs invest in 2D hydraulic models. Letâ€™s use them!
* Mapping substrate is expensive
* Hydraulic only mussel models explain ~%60 of variation
* Is that good enough to make better informed HREP planning decisions?


## Previous UMR Mussel Modeling

* UMESC Pool 8 mussel model
* UMESC Pool 18 mussel model
