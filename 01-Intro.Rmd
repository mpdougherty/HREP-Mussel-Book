# Introduction

Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) has become a common method for mapping suitable habitats for many species or taxa groups [@elith2008working, @elith2009species]. The `dismo` R package has been created to support SDM in R [see the `dismo` package vignette `sdm`, @hijmans2013species]. Another good overview of SDM in R [@hijmans_sdm].
